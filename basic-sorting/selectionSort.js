// Loop over all values and store the minimum value found, then swap the first value by the minimum value found
// Do this, increasing the starting index of the loop by one each time
// Initialize minimum index
// loop over array and assign min index
// loop over remaining values and assing min index to index of the min value found
// If the min was not the first, then swap them
// Careful:
//  Consider the start and end indexes of the loops given that:
//    We need to compare one value, say in position i, to all values from i + 1 to the end of the array
//    Remember: it doesn't make sense to compare i to itself and the loop indexes should reflect that
