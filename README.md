## Algorithm problem solving

tl,dr;

1. Rephrase the problem in your own words to make sure you understand it
2. Define unit tests
3. Write pseudo code / comments defining solution steps
4. Solve. If I don't know how to, try to solve simpler version
5. Refactor

1. Understand the problem (George Polya, How to solve it)
Investigate the problem thorougly before trying to come up with a solution
Questions:
	- Can you restate the problem with your own words?
	- What are the inputs that go into the problem?
	- Outputs?
	- Can the outputs be determined from the inputs?
	- How to label the important pieces of data of the problem?

2. Explore concrete examples (user stories, or using specific inputs. Unit tests)
	- Start with simple examples (write inputs and outputs)
	- Move to more complex cases
	- Explore empty inputs
	- Explore invalid inputs

3. Break it down: write the steps to solve the problem, not necessarily pseudocode, it can be short comments

4. Solve or simplify: if you can solve the problem, solve it. If you can't, solve a simpler problem. Keep out the part that is giving you a hard time and solve the easier part that you know how to solve.

Simplify:
	- Find core difficulty
	- Ignore the difficulty
	- Write simplified solution
	- Incorporate the difficulty back in

5. Look back and refactor
Refactoring questions:
- Can you check the result? (does the code work?)
- Can you derive the result different?
- Can you understand it at a glance? (how intuitive is the solution when looking at the code?)
- Can you use the result or method for some other problem? (sometimes solving a problem unlocks the solution to another problem)
- Can you improve the performance of your solution?
- Can you think of other ways to refactor? (language conventions, styleguides...)
- How have other people solved this problem?
